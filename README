VBScript XML Handler:

Simple .vbs script handling requests to XML files.
Its main purpose is to be used by other programs ( for example, .hta apps ) to easily update their configuration files.

A "tree" request may be supported in the future, but it's not present in the current module responsible for XML handling.

-------- Usage --------

The program accept 2 methods: 'get' and 'set'

Examples:

getting the value of the item present at the XPath "/AppConfig/CheckProcOrWinRunning" in the XML file "app_config__barebone.xml"
.\handle_XML_file.vbs .\app_config__barebone.xml /AppConfig/CheckProcOrWinRunning get

setting the value of the item present at the XPath "/AppConfig/CheckProcOrWinRunning" in the XML file "app_config__barebone.xml" to 'true'
.\handle_XML_file.vbs .\app_config__barebone.xml /AppConfig/CheckProcOrWinRunning set true
